{"name":"Wheresthefoodat","body":"## Setup\r\n\r\nYou need to register a developer account at https://foursquare.com/oauth/.\r\nThen create an app and take note of the clientId. You need to pass this to\r\nyour app as an environment variable. To create the app, you will need to 'register a new consumer'.\r\nFor both its website and callback url, put 'http://localhost:5000' (this is for the dev setup).\r\n\r\nYou also need to create a developer account at http://www.yelp.com/developers/getting_started/api_access.\r\nYou must then generate API keys and take note of the following keys and values:\r\nConsumer Key, Consumer Secret, Token, Token Secret. These also need to be set as environment variables\r\nfor your app (i.e. Consumer Key -> CONSUMER_KEY).\r\n\r\n## API Keys\r\n\r\nTo get the app working locally, put all the keys in a file called '.env'. It should contain one\r\nline for each key/value pair and each line should be of the form:\r\n\r\n    KEY=VALUE\r\n\r\n### Developement\r\n\r\nInstall libraries via 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. You probably want\r\nto use virtualenv for this app (Google it if you don't know how).\r\n\r\nRun the app via 'foreman start -f Procfile.dev'.\r\n\r\nMake sure your app works by going to a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000.\r\n\r\n### Local Production Instance\r\n\r\nRun the app via 'foreman start'.\r\n\r\nMake sure your app works by going to a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000.\r\n\r\n### Heroku Production Instance\r\n\r\nCreate a heroku app.\r\n\r\nConfigure all the environment variables mentioned above using\r\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars\r\n\r\nDeploy and test.\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\nThis app is not ready for production. Some limitations:\r\n\r\n- performance could easily be improved:\r\n  - build / concat js and css files\r\n  - use gzip\r\n  - proxy yelp requests instead of using jsonp\r\n  - use zepto instead of jquery\r\n- get working on IE8\r\n- work in the absence of localstorage\r\n- use retina graphics on iphone / ipad\r\n- better caching\r\n  - far future expires headers for all/most pages\r\n  - smarter cache busting - currently cache is busted for all files on every deploy","tagline":"This is the code that runs http://wheresthefood.at.
